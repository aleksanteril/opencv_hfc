# Head First C - Lab 2

Need to install OpenCV library to work! (Give path in CMakeList.txt)

Using OpenCV library we need to make a image saving software when movement is detected through webcam.
The lab is coded with C++ because from OpenCV version 2.0 upwards there is no C API anymore. Could use libccv library instead to develop in C, but tbc.
